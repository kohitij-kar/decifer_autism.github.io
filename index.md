_This resource currently contains hundreds of facial images (AI created, real photos, cartoons etc.) with varied emotions (with royalty free usage permit). In addition, the predicted "**diagnostic efficiency**" of the image-sets (i.e., ability to optimally discrminate between behaviors of individuals with autism or neurotypical development) as predicted by various models of primate vision are also provided here. This is a work in progress and I hope over time, the community will grow to include researchers doing clinical work who can test and validate these predictions"_
